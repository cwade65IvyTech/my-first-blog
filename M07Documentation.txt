When attempting to complete the website security portion of this assignment, I ran into an issue where the logout feature would display properly,
 but would instead lead to an error upon use.  After doing some research, I found a stackoverflow post about the same issue I was running into.
 The post showed me how to corrrect the issue by changing the logout code in the base.html file.
 This correction did provide me with a functional logout, but the styling of the new logout button was unfitting to the rest of the webpage.
 To remedy this issue, I did some more research and spent some time messing with the html code until I was able to reach a point where the styling matched the rest of the site.

Code changed:
 <p id="logout" class="top-menu">Hello {{ user.username }} <small><a href="{% url 'logout' %}">(Log out)</a></small></p>
to:
<p id="logout" class="top-menu">Hello {{ user.username }}
     <small>
        <form method="post" action="{% url 'logout' %}">
            {% csrf_token %}
            <button type="submit", style="background-color: #c25100; color: white; font-family: 'Lobster', cursive; margin-left: 1100px;">logout</button>
        </form>
    </small>
